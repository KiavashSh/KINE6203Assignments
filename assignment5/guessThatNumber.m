% DESCRIPTION: This program is supposed to allow the user to play
%              the Number Guessing Game, however, it contains bugs.
%              Your job is to find, correct, and mark the errors with
%              comments describing the bug, how you found it, 
%              and how you corrected it. Correct the bugs and submit this
%              corrected file on github. There are between 9 - 12 bugs,
%              depending on how you correct them.

% Get level of play (1-3) from user

fprintf('Please select one of the three levels of play:\n')
fprintf('   1) Beginner (range is 1 to %d)\n', beginnerHighest)

level = input('Enter level (1-3): '); 

while level ~= 1 && level ~= 2 && level ~= 3  %Bug 1 found: if the user should enter a level from 1 to 3, 
    % it must be level ~= 1 && level ~= 2 && level ~= 3 to check if the user correctly enters the number but the original version was
    %level ~= beginner || level ~= moderate || level ~= advanced that was
    %wrong because it does not contain the numbers. Also The condition
    %should ensure that level is not equal to any of the valid options.That
    %is why the || replaced with &&. The original condition will always evaluate to true. Hereâ€™s why:
    %If level is  1, level ~= 2 || level ~= 3 is true, making the entire condition true.
    %If level is 2, level ~= 1 is true, so the condition remains true.
    %If level is 3, level ~= 1 || level ~= 2 is true, so again, the entire
fprintf('Sorry, that is not a valid level selection.\n')
level = input('Please re-enter a level of play (1-3): ');
end

% set highest secret number based on level selected

if level == beginner %Bug 2 found: I found this by trying to run the code and getting a incorrect use of '=' error message.
%level = beginner, stores beginner in level. However, level == beginner checks if the value of level is beginner.        

highest = beginnerHighest;

elseif level == moderate

highest = moderateHighest;

else
highest = advancedHighest; %Bug 3 found: advancedhighest should be advancedHighest        
end

% randomly select secret number between 1 and highest for level of play

secretNumber = floor(rand() * highest);  %Bug 4 found: for generating a number between 1 and the highest the appropriate approach 
% is rounding a random number between 0 and 1 and multiply it by the
% highest value but the original version (floor(rand() + 1 * highest))
% rounded a value between the highest value and the highest value + rand()

% initialize number of guesses and User_guess

numOfTries = 1; %Bug 5 found: it should start with 0 otherwise when it wants to check if it exceed the alowable number of try
% it gives you one other chance to guess a number
userGuess = 0;

% repeatedly get user's guess until the user guesses correctly

while userGuess ~= secretNumber

% get a valid guess (an integer from 1-Highest) from the user
if numOfTries >5 %Bug 6 found: for showing Game Over there must be a condition that meets it and this is numOfTries >20. Also this 
    % condition is seperate from the previous condition. Therefore, elseif
    % should be here  to difrentiate between this condition and the
    % previous condition
fprintf('Game Over. Thanks for playing the Guess That Number game.\n\n');
break %Bug 7 found:To avoid continuing the while loop, I wrote a break statement to exit the loop if the user gets a game over.

end % of guess validation loop

% add 1 to the number of guesses the user has made




% report whether the user's guess was high, low, or correct

if userGuess < secretNumber %Bug 8 found: if the user guess is too low it should be userGuess < secretNumber but the original code was userGuess > secretNumber
fprintf('Sorry, %d is too low.\n', userGuess);

elseif userGuess > secretNumber 
fprintf('Sorry, %d is too high.\n', userGuess);

elseif numOfTries == 1 & userGuess == secretNumber   %Bug 9 found: we shoudl have two condition here: the first one should check if it is the first time they guess and got the correct answer 
    % that is shown by this code. the other thing that should be considered is if the userGuess is the secretNumber (userGuess == secretNumber) 
fprintf('\nLucky You!  You got it on your first try!\n\n');
else

fprintf('\nCongratulations!  You got %d in %d tries.\n\n',secretNumber,numOfTries);%Bug 10 found: for the first %d in "You got %d in %d tries" 
% the code should returns secretNumber and for the second %d it should
% return numOfTries. in the original version which was
% fprintf('\nCongratulations!  You got %d in %d tries.\n\n',secretNumber)
% it returns secretNumber for both ds.

end  % of guessing while loop
numOfTries = numOfTries + 1;%Bug 11 found:the increment should be after checking all of the conditional functions. 
% otherwise when it returns numOfTries the number would be one more than
% the actual number of try
end %Bug 13 found: there was no end for the while loop in the original code. the end of loop should be the place after 
% checking all of the possibility of the user guess
